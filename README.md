# FunCaptcha_Fingerprint
Get funcaptcha fingerprints from a browser without the need to reverse engineer or rewrite anything. Simply load their javascript and call their own functions!

This will give you the fingerprint of the browser you are visiting the site on. The fingerprint will work with your solver (if you have one lol) and wont cause any issues (unless you're already flagged)
